# The Narrow Path Web App
This Blazor Server project provides organized and enhanced access to Steve Gregg's audio teachings, lectures, and sermons. The goal is to provide a straightforward interface with organized access to content through one responsive code base. 
The current web app hosted at [thenarrowpath.app](https://thenarrowpath.app).
# Considerations
This project is not profiting from or attempting to monetize Steve Gregg's content. Neither is any attempt being made to replace or undermine his ministries many established web resources and online presence. Simply it is an attempt to provide a focused connection to this content freely available on his website and other well established social media platforms. 
All source code, time, hosting, and assets contained within are freely given to meet the goals of creating a useful application for all to enjoy and provide easy access to the audio content of Steve Gregg's ministry.

# Code Base
We have chosen to use a Blazor Server application based on its responsive design framework and strong back end support. 
### Frameworks and Libraries:
* .NET 6.0 
* Blazor Server
* MudBlazor
# Acknowledgements
There are going to be inherent problems within any framework trying to meet the needs of all platforms. We have done our very best to overcome some of these, but from time to time we will find that, despite our best intentions, the operating system or hardware just do not allow a web application the same first class access as proprietary applications. We just have to be ok with that. There may be another way to accomplish the goal; if there is we will find it.
